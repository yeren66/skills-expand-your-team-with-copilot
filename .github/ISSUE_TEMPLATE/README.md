## How to Use Templates

1. **Go to the Issues tab** in this GitHub repository
2. **Click "New Issue"**

4. **Fill out all required fields** - the more detail you provide, the better Copilot can help
5. **Submit the issue** - it will be automatically labeled and ready for assignment

## Tips for Success

- **Be specific** - Instead of "login doesn't work", say "teachers can't log in with school email addresses"
- **Include examples** - Show current text and exactly what you want it to say
- **Mention devices** - Note if problems happen on phones, computers, or both
- **Add context** - Explain why the change is needed and who it affects
- **Use acceptance criteria** - List specific things that must work when the issue is complete
