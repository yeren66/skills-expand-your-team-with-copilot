# Bug Analysis Report

## Issue Information
- **Title:** Missing School Pride
- **Description:** The website is blue, but our school colors are white and lime green. Please fix this.

Also, why are none of our mascots on the page?
Please use the various options from https://octodex.github.com/

Oh one more idea, I think it would look cool if the background had various Git-style branch lines slowly animating! That's easy, right?

## AI Analysis Summary
